## The Last Mile
That was the buzzword for the hackathon carrying a meaning that after all the years of collecting, organizing and storing climate data, it is now time for technology to make use of them and provide cutting edge applications.

The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) launched this for the application developers to create new web or mobile applications that give out weather data in areas trying to adapt to climate change in the region.

Under the UNDP programme called Climate Information for Resilient Development in Africa (CIRDA), software developers were invited to Livingstone, Zambia to participate.

The developers formed teams to create prototype mobile and information-system-based applications and technological solutions to share actionable weather and climate information with a variety of stakeholders, sectors and end-users.

As a result different applications and platforms were prototyped [here](https://climateaction.io/) is the list.

I had a chance to go this hackathon, it was wonderful to meet people who have been working on useful information on climate. It was so amazing when we got to realize how much some of the companies have worked on providing useful tools around gathered climate data.
